# D2tracker

This is a tool for helping Diablo 2 (Resurrected) players easier keep track of their runs, items and mules. The purpose is to have an easy to use, quick and easy way of tracking your game progress, without any hassle. The web app is powered with Firestore so the users progress is stored, safe and secure.

### Instructions
The run tracker let's the user create a game and what run their going to make. Then, a timer starts when the player is ready. The player will then, when the run is over press next run which will open a dialog where they can add items from a database of all uniques and sets in the game, or enter a custom item. When the items have been added, a next run is initatied with a cooldown (set by the users) so they can rejoin a new game in the meantime. When the run is done, the player exits the game which will take them to a summary screen, showing all item drops, time spent and avg. run speed.
